      "Article title: Alan Rickman & Rupert Grint On 'CBGB,' Reuniting Post-'Potter' And Favorite Halloween Costumes\n",
      "\n",
      "Article: The mythology of punk music's evolution can be traced back, more or less, to one singular staple: CBGB. Opened in 1973 in downtown Manhattan's East Village, the nightclub that originally intended to house country, bluegrass and blues music (hint its acronym) quickly became a breeding ground for bands like The Ramones, Talking Heads and The Police, among countless others. The legacy of the club, which closed in 2006 over a rent dispute, is on display in a new movie that stars Alan Rickman as bemused owner Hilly Kristal. It's a bit of a departure for anyone more accustomed to seeing Rickman, 67, play sinister Severus Snape in \"Harry Potter\" or Judge Turpin in \"Sweeney Todd.\" The movie also afforded him the opportunity to reunite with fellow Hogwarts alum Rupert Grint, who portrays one-third of derriere-bearing punk band The Dead Boys, alongside Justin Bartha and Bronson Adams. They're joined by a revolving door of notable faces, including Malin Akerman as Debbie Harry, Taylor Hawkins as Iggy Pop, Johnny Galecki as Terry Ork and Ashley Greene as Hilly's daughter Lisa. HuffPost Entertainment snagged some phone time with Rickman and Grint, who were candid about their unfamiliarity with CBGB's legacy but effusive about the excitement that came with reconvening for the project. Plus, Grint talks about his own punk phase and Rickman explains what Halloween used to mean for him. What are you up to today? Rickman: I'm in New York. I'm just here for three or four days for \"CBGB\" in New York and then back to work in England. Grint: I'm rehearsing a play that will start [in London] in a couple of weeks. Yeah, so that's it. Are you enjoying the theater work? Are you more of a theater guy or a film guy? Grint: I don’t know, really. This is my first theater experience, and it’s very different. I wanted to just try it; it’s something I’ve always wanted to do. Just the thought of it scares me. I’ve kind of put it off for a long time, and I just thought it was a good time to do it. And it’s a great play and a really great cast with a great director, and it was just, yeah, I’m enjoying it. Were you familiar with the legacy of CBGB as a breeding ground for the punk-rock scene prior to taking your roles in the movie? Rickman: I wasn’t familiar with CBGB at all. I didn’t know about it and didn’t know its history. I hadn’t even really heard those four letters put together because at that time I was very much in England as a drama student and an art student, so it’s all been a newand you’d have apple bobbing in it, and you’d get apples out of a bowl of water. To me it just means a soaking wet shirt. Grint: I liked Halloween. It never used to be a big thing when I was kid. We never really did it. But I actually had a good costume not that long ago. The last one, I dressed as a Play-Doh can that I made. You know Play-Doh? Of course. Grint: Well, literally, I actually made it. It was a yellow bin. I cut the bottom out and I just wore a yellow bin with a Play-Doh logo. With a yellow hat. It’s not very practical. Do you have a favorite Halloween candy? Rickman: I don’t even know what that means. The word \"chocolate\" would loom large. Grint: A favorite Halloween candy? I don’t really know. I never trick-or-treated when I was younger because we lived on a block of houses that were all just kind of elderly people who were just scared to answer the door. But yeah, candy corn, that’s a big thing. I’ve tried that. That’s pretty great. \"CBGB\" is out in limited release now.\n",

      "prediction: ['Ted Cruz dominated talk time at the GOP debate', 'Description: In the last GOP debate, Cruz spoke for a full three minutes more than his closest rival.', 'Article: The debate has seen a quality-over-quantity approach from Ted Cruz as he intensifies his criticisms of Donald Trump. | AP Photo Ted Cruz dominated talk time at the GOP debate Ted Cruz commanded the rhythm of Thursday\\'s GOP debate, mixing extended barbs directed at Donald Trump with his typical stump speech maxims. There wasn\\'t a subject or segment Cruz didn\\'t wiggle into. Trump, drawn into duels with Cruz, didn\\'t back down, calling the Texan\\'s comments about New Yorkers \"insulting\" at one point. Trump still spoke for a significant segment of the debate, sticking to a steady routine of interruptions without getting tested too seriously. Yet late in the debate, Trump\\'s presence dissipated slightly, opening a spot for Marco Rubio, who used his increased time to take on Cruz, who he sparred with most frequently in the previous debate. Halfway through Thursday\\'s slugfest it appeared Rubio would be mostly shunned by his opponents, but he used an almost two-minute segment to air a litany of Cruz\\'s flip-flops on immigration, which Cruz parried. The final count had Cruz speaking the most for the third straight debate, finishing at 18 minutes and three seconds. Trump came in second with 17 minutes and 8 seconds. Rubio spoke for just over 14 minutes. The ever-muted Ben Carson finished last, speaking for just eight minutes and 25 seconds.

      "prediction: [\"Helping others will lead to 'generosity burnout' and can damage your career\", 'Description: Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania professor, Dr Adam Grant, and researcher Reb Rebele, explain that selflessness at work ends up hurting the very people you intended to help.', \"Article: We're always being encouraged to help others before we help ourselves. And in the workplace putting your needs before those of your colleagues is often seen as selfish behaviour. But new research says being selfless at work can backfire. Giving at the expense of your own well-being damages your chance of long-term success. In an article for The Harvard Business Review, Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania professor, Dr Adam Grant and Wharton People Analytics researcher Reb Rebele explore the 'generosity burnout'. They believe that selflessness at work leads to exhaustion, and ironically often hurts the people you intended to help. 'Although givers are the most valuable people in organizations, they’re also at the greatest risk for burnout', the authors wrote in The Harvard Business Review. 'When they don’t protect themselves, their investments in others can cause them to feel overloaded and fatigued, fall behind in their work goals, and face more stress and conflict at home', they said. In their currently unpublished research, authors Dr Grant and Mr Rebele studied a range of jobs. One data set came from a study conducted with more than 400 teachers in schools throughout the US. At the start of the year they asked them questions about their approach to helping others. Their answers allowed the authors to predict how well their students would do in their exams at the end of the year. Here is a sample question from their test, quoted in Business Insider: 1. Prioritise - say yes when it matters most. 2. Give in a way that is in your own interest and preserves your own energy resources. 3. Don't be afraid to refer work to other people when you don't have time. 4. Amplify your impact - look for ways to help many people in a single gesture. 5- Dedicate blocks of time to giving rather than doing it all the time. It'll make you more focussed and effective. 6 - Avoid people who only take - they'll drain your energy. Source:  Harvard Business Review Imagine that you're teaching a geometry class, and you've volunteered to stay after school one day a week to help one of your students, Alex, improve his understanding of geometry. He asks if you'll also help his friend Juan, who isn't in your class. What would you do? a. Schedule a separate after-school session to help Juan, so you can better understand his individual needs. b. Invite Juan to sit in on your geometry sessions with Alex. c. Tell Alex that it's nice that he wants to help Juan, but he really needs to focus on his own work in order to catch up. d. Tell Alex that Juan should ask his own teacher for help. Surprisingly, the pupils with teachers who answered (a) did the worst in their end of year exams. The teachers who protected themselves and were less selfless got their students better marks. 'Selfless educators exhausted themselves trying to help everyone with every request', the authors said. In the end, they were damaging the very students they wanted to help. Not only in teaching, but selfless people suffer most in workplaces and find themselves drowning in admin and unable to pursue their own goals as a result. Their research also showed people who protect their own time can give the most long-term contribution. Their work shows it's about balancing time so when you help other people you don't set yourself back in the process. Dr Grant and Mr Rebele explain that you need to remember three key things when giving to other people: 'being thoughtful about how you help, when you help, and whom you help.' No one can be available all the time to help other people.\", 'Tags: Why, selfish, work', \"Why you SHOULD be selfish at work: Helping others will lead to 'generosity burnout' and can damage your career\", 'Why you']\n",

      "prediction: ['you keep clicking', 'Description: The show hit at just the right time to ride the growing TV recap boom.', \"Article: One of the most consistent criticisms of Mad Men from those who aren't Mad Men fans is that — sniffs derisively — it's only beloved by the coastal media elite, because it's about rich white people who live glamorous lives and work in advertising. That strain of criticism became all the more pronounced in the buildup to the AMC drama's series finale, with Vulture launching the latest broadside against the show's popularity as author Michael Idov argued that it wasn't truly popular, just overhyped. (To support his claim, he points, in part, to the show's lack of an audience in Russia.) To some degree, this is true. Back when the series debuted, the media wrote about Mad Men to a level far exceeding its actual ratings. The first season's viewership numbers dipped below the 1 million mark a few times — a much more perilous event in an age when DVRs and streaming services were less prevalent. But by season two, the awards and critical attention Mad Men garnered ended up boosting those numbers to more comfortable levels, and even if the show was never a smash hit, it had a long, healthy run. Still, there are a bunch of good, mostly reductive reasons for the media to keep, in Idov's words, shoving Mad Men down readers' throats. Here are five. 1) Readers wanted to read about it In my pre-Vox life, I was the TV editor of The A.V. Club, a position that gave me unique insight into what sorts of TV content readers wanted to consume. And every time we wrote about Mad Men, those numbers spiked. The show was consistently among the top five series we wrote about in terms of readership, and a well-timed thinkpiece always had the potential to blow up. The Mad Men audience overlaps so neatly with the audience of people who read about TV on the internet that the Venn diagram of the two might as well be a single circle This has carried right over to Vox. We write a lot about the show because there's a huge audience out there ready to devour Mad Men content — far beyond any other show I've written about here that's not Game of Thrones. The Mad Men audience overlaps so neatly with the audience of people who read about TV on the internet that the Venn diagram of the two might as well be a single circle. Yes, the huge explosion of commentary in the days preceding the show's finale was driven by how much many of us in the media liked the show. But it was also driven by the fact that our readers wanted to see this sort of material. Some of that was an accident of timing. 2) Mad Men ned the series as a sort of lifestyle choice — if you were cool, you would watch Mad Men. But TV sites have said that about a lot of shows over the years, and few of them held up, readership-wise, as well as Mad Men did. (Whither Boardwalk Empire?) Yes, the early push might have been a bit much, but Mad Men ended up having the goods — at least for the people who cared about it. I agree with the theoretical concerns behind the criticisms of media coverage of Mad Men. Those of us who write about television do too often ignore the shows that a majority of Americans are actually watching, shows like The Big Bang Theory and NCIS and even Empire. But the kinds of people who read our websites are also far more likely to want to take a deep dive into the latest episode of Mad Men than they are to want to read a careful analysis of even several episodes of NCIS. (Believe me. I've tried.) The answer to why the media keeps pushing Mad Men on the people is simple: the people keep pushing it on us.\", 'This is why the media can’t stop writing about Mad Men: you keep clicking', 'A:', 'I think the answer is that the media is trying to sell you something']\n",

       " 'targetParagraphs': ['While the combination of ramen noodles and coffee usually don’t go together, the making of those noodles within a coffee pot offers up a unique way to cook them. To begin the process, you should simply crumble up the noodles within a package, since the smaller size will make it easier to heat the product up.',\n",
       "  'From there, place the noodles in the coffee pot, making sure that all of the noodles are exposed. Next, bring together any other items you might want to add and then fill the pot with a few cups of water. That’s followed by then turning the pot on, with the process lasting anywhere between two to three minutes. Once that’s been completed, the food should be ready, with the added items adding some flavoring to the overall mix. One important thing to remember is that prior to using the pot, make sure to wash it thoroughly. Otherwise, the ramen noodles will inevitably have a strong coffee-based taste, which may ruin this otherwise ingenious idea.',\n",
       "  'This food has been an iconic staple for many college students who are forced to stretch their tight budgets. That’s because of the low cost of these noodles and the ordinarily uncomplicated manner of cooking them. One of the few drawbacks to eating this food is that each packet of it is loaded with sodium, with many packets containing over 1,800 milligrams of sodium per serving. That’s in comparison to the overall suggested daily intake of 2,300 milligrams.'],\n",

       " ['People regularly use to have two periods of sleep and do tasks in between, Description: Professor Roger Ekirch of Virginia Polytechnic and State University claims people used to have a first sleep and a second sleep and it was a normal practice until the late 1800s., only to wake up in the middle of the night frustratedly unable to get back to sleep. While today this is seen as insomnia, until the end of the 19th century people did it on purpose. Well after the Industrial Revolution, many people in Britain still swore by the health benefits of a ‘first sleep’ and ‘second sleep’. For centuries, according to a sleep historian, they would use the time when they woke up at night to do household chores, visit friends - or make love to their spouse. Sleeping through the night is by comparison a ‘modern invention’, according to Professor Roger Ekirch of Virginia Polytechnic and State University. Speaking yesterday at the Royal Society of Medicine, he said: ‘Middle of the night insomnia was a rare problem before the late 1800s. As early as in the 16th century it was utterly normal, unworthy of comment.’ Bedtime was historically around 10pm, after which, he added: ‘Most individuals awakened shortly past midnight to an hour or so of consciousness, in which they meditated, they conversed and made love - not necessarily in that order. ‘A 16th century physician said making love was better after the first sleep, when people have more enjoyment and do it better.’ People used the gap between their first and second sleep to wash clothes, have a conversation or even to steal the neighbour’s firewood, historical records show. It was thought that lovemaking between the two sleep phases was responsible for large families, with labourers able to conceive several children because they waited until after their energy-giving first sleep to do it. It was also thought to aid digestion, if people turned from lying on their right to their left when they woke up during the night. References to two phases of sleep go back to Chaucer, with a character in The Squire’s Tale, in the Canterbury Tales, deciding to go back to bed after her ‘firste sleep’. Unless kept awake by a cold house, bed bugs or worry, most people were unconcerned about getting up in the night. It was not seen as insomnia, and ‘sleeplessness’ referred only to failing to fall asleep in the first place. But the practice of having a first and second sleep fell out of favour in the decades following the Industrial Revolution, when people increasingly worked long hours as machine manufacturing dominated British industry. The sleep historian said the shift came at the end of the 19th century, as the end of the first sleep crept later to around 3am, before it was jettisoned altogether. Suddenly sleeping in two phases was seen as inefficient and people were warned that indulging would lead to headaches and constipation. It was even feared that it might, in young men and women, cause ‘lustful thoughts’. Speaking at a Royal society event in London on the subject of sleep, Prof Ekirch said: ‘Sleep represented a necessary evil best confined to a single interval, thus allowing someone to steal the march on the day and on one’s fellow human beings who were still enjoying their second sleep.’ As a result, today, the history professor said, many people who wake at night think they are ‘abnormal’. However research suggests this may be a normal sleeping pattern when people are away from artificial lights and the blue light from electronic devices. Prof Erich said: ‘Rather than the product of an implacable disorder, their sleep, viewed from the high ground of history, may just be natural.’, Tags: Why, waking, night, natural, Why waking up in the night is natural: People regularly use to have two periods of sleep and do tasks in between, Why waking up in'],\n",
