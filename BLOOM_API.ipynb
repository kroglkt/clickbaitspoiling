      "Article title: Alan Rickman & Rupert Grint On 'CBGB,' Reuniting Post-'Potter' And Favorite Halloween Costumes\n",
      "\n",
      "Article: The mythology of punk music's evolution can be traced back, more or less, to one singular staple: CBGB. Opened in 1973 in downtown Manhattan's East Village, the nightclub that originally intended to house country, bluegrass and blues music (hint its acronym) quickly became a breeding ground for bands like The Ramones, Talking Heads and The Police, among countless others. The legacy of the club, which closed in 2006 over a rent dispute, is on display in a new movie that stars Alan Rickman as bemused owner Hilly Kristal. It's a bit of a departure for anyone more accustomed to seeing Rickman, 67, play sinister Severus Snape in \"Harry Potter\" or Judge Turpin in \"Sweeney Todd.\" The movie also afforded him the opportunity to reunite with fellow Hogwarts alum Rupert Grint, who portrays one-third of derriere-bearing punk band The Dead Boys, alongside Justin Bartha and Bronson Adams. They're joined by a revolving door of notable faces, including Malin Akerman as Debbie Harry, Taylor Hawkins as Iggy Pop, Johnny Galecki as Terry Ork and Ashley Greene as Hilly's daughter Lisa. HuffPost Entertainment snagged some phone time with Rickman and Grint, who were candid about their unfamiliarity with CBGB's legacy but effusive about the excitement that came with reconvening for the project. Plus, Grint talks about his own punk phase and Rickman explains what Halloween used to mean for him. What are you up to today? Rickman: I'm in New York. I'm just here for three or four days for \"CBGB\" in New York and then back to work in England. Grint: I'm rehearsing a play that will start [in London] in a couple of weeks. Yeah, so that's it. Are you enjoying the theater work? Are you more of a theater guy or a film guy? Grint: I don’t know, really. This is my first theater experience, and it’s very different. I wanted to just try it; it’s something I’ve always wanted to do. Just the thought of it scares me. I’ve kind of put it off for a long time, and I just thought it was a good time to do it. And it’s a great play and a really great cast with a great director, and it was just, yeah, I’m enjoying it. Were you familiar with the legacy of CBGB as a breeding ground for the punk-rock scene prior to taking your roles in the movie? Rickman: I wasn’t familiar with CBGB at all. I didn’t know about it and didn’t know its history. I hadn’t even really heard those four letters put together because at that time I was very much in England as a drama student and an art student, so it’s all been a newand you’d have apple bobbing in it, and you’d get apples out of a bowl of water. To me it just means a soaking wet shirt. Grint: I liked Halloween. It never used to be a big thing when I was kid. We never really did it. But I actually had a good costume not that long ago. The last one, I dressed as a Play-Doh can that I made. You know Play-Doh? Of course. Grint: Well, literally, I actually made it. It was a yellow bin. I cut the bottom out and I just wore a yellow bin with a Play-Doh logo. With a yellow hat. It’s not very practical. Do you have a favorite Halloween candy? Rickman: I don’t even know what that means. The word \"chocolate\" would loom large. Grint: A favorite Halloween candy? I don’t really know. I never trick-or-treated when I was younger because we lived on a block of houses that were all just kind of elderly people who were just scared to answer the door. But yeah, candy corn, that’s a big thing. I’ve tried that. That’s pretty great. \"CBGB\" is out in limited release now.\n",

When Salman enters it looks like a big star has entered. When I enter feels like a waiter has entered. No offense to waiters. But I just mean that when I enter it doesn’t feel like a star has entered. So Salman and Shah Rukh are bigger stars than I am. I think between myself, Aamir and Salman we have huge liking towards each other. I also feel they are bigger stars than me. If you ask me I will say that thing and if you ask Salman he will say same thing.
