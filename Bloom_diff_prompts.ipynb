      "Article title: Alan Rickman & Rupert Grint On 'CBGB,' Reuniting Post-'Potter' And Favorite Halloween Costumes\n",
      "\n",
      "Article: The mythology of punk music's evolution can be traced back, more or less, to one singular staple: CBGB. Opened in 1973 in downtown Manhattan's East Village, the nightclub that originally intended to house country, bluegrass and blues music (hint its acronym) quickly became a breeding ground for bands like The Ramones, Talking Heads and The Police, among countless others. The legacy of the club, which closed in 2006 over a rent dispute, is on display in a new movie that stars Alan Rickman as bemused owner Hilly Kristal. It's a bit of a departure for anyone more accustomed to seeing Rickman, 67, play sinister Severus Snape in \"Harry Potter\" or Judge Turpin in \"Sweeney Todd.\" The movie also afforded him the opportunity to reunite with fellow Hogwarts alum Rupert Grint, who portrays one-third of derriere-bearing punk band The Dead Boys, alongside Justin Bartha and Bronson Adams. They're joined by a revolving door of notable faces, including Malin Akerman as Debbie Harry, Taylor Hawkins as Iggy Pop, Johnny Galecki as Terry Ork and Ashley Greene as Hilly's daughter Lisa. HuffPost Entertainment snagged some phone time with Rickman and Grint, who were candid about their unfamiliarity with CBGB's legacy but effusive about the excitement that came with reconvening for the project. Plus, Grint talks about his own punk phase and Rickman explains what Halloween used to mean for him. What are you up to today? Rickman: I'm in New York. I'm just here for three or four days for \"CBGB\" in New York and then back to work in England. Grint: I'm rehearsing a play that will start [in London] in a couple of weeks. Yeah, so that's it. Are you enjoying the theater work? Are you more of a theater guy or a film guy? Grint: I don’t know, really. This is my first theater experience, and it’s very different. I wanted to just try it; it’s something I’ve always wanted to do. Just the thought of it scares me. I’ve kind of put it off for a long time, and I just thought it was a good time to do it. And it’s a great play and a really great cast with a great director, and it was just, yeah, I’m enjoying it. Were you familiar with the legacy of CBGB as a breeding ground for the punk-rock scene prior to taking your roles in the movie? Rickman: I wasn’t familiar with CBGB at all. I didn’t know about it and didn’t know its history. I hadn’t even really heard those four letters put together because at that time I was very much in England as a drama student and an art student, so it’s all been a newand you’d have apple bobbing in it, and you’d get apples out of a bowl of water. To me it just means a soaking wet shirt. Grint: I liked Halloween. It never used to be a big thing when I was kid. We never really did it. But I actually had a good costume not that long ago. The last one, I dressed as a Play-Doh can that I made. You know Play-Doh? Of course. Grint: Well, literally, I actually made it. It was a yellow bin. I cut the bottom out and I just wore a yellow bin with a Play-Doh logo. With a yellow hat. It’s not very practical. Do you have a favorite Halloween candy? Rickman: I don’t even know what that means. The word \"chocolate\" would loom large. Grint: A favorite Halloween candy? I don’t really know. I never trick-or-treated when I was younger because we lived on a block of houses that were all just kind of elderly people who were just scared to answer the door.

Opened in 1973 in downtown Manhattan's East Village, the nightclub that originally intended to house country, bluegrass and blues music (hint its acronym) quickly became a breeding ground for bands like The Ramones, Talking Heads and The Police, among countless others. The legacy of the club, which closed in 2006 over a rent dispute, is on display in a new movie that stars Alan Rickman as bemused owner Hilly Kristal. It's a bit of a departure for anyone more accustomed to seeing Rickman, 67, play sinister Severus Snape in \\\"Harry Potter\\\" or Judge Turpin in \\\"Sweeney Todd.\\\" The movie also afforded him the opportunity to reunite with fellow Hogwarts alum Rupert Grint, who portrays one-third of derriere-bearing punk band The Dead Boys, alongside Justin Bartha and Bronson Adams. They're joined by a revolving door of notable faces, including Malin Akerman as Debbie Harry, Taylor Hawkins as Iggy Pop, Johnny Galecki as Terry Ork and Ashley Greene as Hilly's daughter Lisa. HuffPost Entertainment snagged some phone time with Rickman and Grint, who were candid about their unfamiliarity with CBGB's legacy but effusive about the excitement that came with reconvening for the project. Plus, Grint talks about his own punk phase and Rickman explains what Halloween used to mean for him. What are you up to today? Rickman: I'm in New York. I'm just here for three or four days for \\\"CBGB\\\" in New York and then back to work in England. Grint: I'm rehearsing a play that will start [in London] in a couple of weeks. Yeah, so that's it. Are you enjoying the theater work? Are you more of a theater guy or a film guy? Grint: I don’t know, really. This is my first theater experience, and it’s very different. I wanted to just try it; it’s something I’ve always wanted to do. Just the thought of it scares me. I’ve kind of put it off for a long time, and I just thought it was a good time to do it. And it’s a great play and a really great cast with a great director, and it was just, yeah, I’m enjoying it. Were you familiar with the legacy of CBGB as a breeding ground for the punk-rock scene prior to taking your roles in the movie? Rickman: I wasn’t familiar with CBGB at all. I didn’t know about it and didn’t know its history. I hadn’t even really heard those four letters put together because at that time I was very much in England as a drama student and an art student, so it’s all been a newand you’d have apple bobbing in it, and you’d get apples out of a bowl of water. To me it just means a soaking wet shirt. Grint: I liked Halloween. It never used to be a big thing when I was kid. We never really did it. But I actually had a good costume not that long ago. The last one, I dressed as a Play-Doh can that I made. You know Play-Doh? Of course. Grint: Well, literally, I actually made it. It was a yellow bin. I cut the bottom out and I just wore a yellow bin with a Play-Doh logo. With a yellow hat. It’s not very practical. Do you have a favorite Halloween candy? Rickman: I don’t even know what that means.

While today this is seen as insomnia, until the end of the 19th century people did it on purpose. Well after the Industrial Revolution, many people in Britain still swore by the health benefits of a ‘first sleep’ and ‘second sleep’. For centuries, according to a sleep historian, they would use the time when they woke up at night to do household chores, visit friends - or make love to their spouse. Sleeping through the night is by comparison a ‘modern invention’, according to Professor Roger Ekirch of Virginia Polytechnic and State University. Speaking yesterday at the Royal Society of Medicine, he said: ‘Middle of the night insomnia was a rare problem before the late 1800s. As early as in the 16th century it was utterly normal, unworthy of comment.’ Bedtime was historically around 10pm, after which, he added: ‘Most individuals awakened shortly past midnight to an hour or so of consciousness, in which they meditated, they conversed and made love - not necessarily in that order. ‘A 16th century physician said making love was better after the first sleep, when people have more enjoyment and do it better.’ People used the gap between their first and second sleep to wash clothes, have a conversation or even to steal the neighbour’s firewood, historical records show. It was thought that lovemaking between the two sleep phases was responsible for large families, with labourers able to conceive several children because they waited until after their energy-giving first sleep to do it. It was also thought to aid digestion, if people turned from lying on their right to their left when they woke up during the night. References to two phases of sleep go back to Chaucer, with a character in The Squire’s Tale, in the Canterbury Tales, deciding to go back to bed after her ‘firste sleep’. Unless kept awake by a cold house, bed bugs or worry, most people were unconcerned about getting up in the night. It was not seen as insomnia, and ‘sleeplessness’ referred only to failing to fall asleep in the first place. But the practice of having a first and second sleep fell out of favour in the decades following the Industrial Revolution, when people increasingly worked long hours as machine manufacturing dominated British industry. The sleep historian said the shift came at the end of the 19th century, as the end of the first sleep crept later to around 3am, before it was jettisoned altogether. Suddenly sleeping in two phases was seen as inefficient and people were warned that indulging would lead to headaches and constipation. It was even feared that it might, in young men and women, cause ‘lustful thoughts’. Speaking at a Royal society event in London on the subject of sleep, Prof Ekirch said: ‘Sleep represented a necessary evil best confined to a single interval, thus allowing someone to steal the march on the day and on one’s fellow human beings who were still enjoying their second sleep.’ As a result, today, the history professor said, many people who wake at night think they are ‘abnormal’. However research suggests this may be a normal sleeping pattern when people are away from artificial lights and the blue light from electronic devices. Prof Erich said: ‘Rather than the product of an implacable disorder, their sleep, viewed from the high ground of history, may just be natural.’', 'Tags: Why, waking, night, natural', 'Why waking up in the night is natural: People regularly use to have two periods of sleep and do tasks in between', 'A:', 'The article i']\n",

We’d all like to think that we’d do the right thing and rush to help, but sometimes fear or concern for our own safety makes us take pause. For California resident Sharon Bertozzi, however, that protective instinct came without hesitation. When she saw a weak animal on her front porch, she immediately sprung into action. Little did she know, this creature had quite a surprise in store for her... One afternoon, Sharon discovered a small fur ball curled up behind a vase on her front porch. She assumed the animal was a very sick dog and quickly decided to help. Sharon placed the poor creature inside a small cage that she had in her garage. Though she knew the dog couldn’t be kept in there for long, it was clearly better than nothing. The tiny pup desperately needed help - fortunately, Sharon had the phone number of a local animal rescue team on hand and dialed immediately. Sharon had called the City of Folsom Animal Services. Thinking things were about wrapped up, Sharon was told something by rescuer Cindy Walden that she could not believe. The sick dog Sharon rescued was actually a female coyote who was suffering from a particularly bad case of mange. \"She had such soft eyes, that relayed the message of ‘help me if you can,\\'\" Cindy said. Gold Country Wildlife Rescue (GCWR) came soon enough and took the coyote to their shelter, later naming the animal Princess. Luckily, GCWR was specialized in providing care and rehabilitation for coyotes. Princess was eventually taken to Sierra Wildlife Rescue in Placerville, California, when she was feeling well enough. There, workers continued to care for her so she could make a full recovery. Here she was able to interact with other coyotes, which came as a huge relief it had obviously been a while since Princess was able to spend time in the company of her own species... Princess soon became friends with the two coyotes that she was placed with. Both were around her age and eager to get to know her. The three of them seemed to get along well, much to the relief of the rescue workers. Princess and her new coyote buddies developed a close bond while they were at the wildlife rescue. Workers knew that it wouldn’t be long until they were released back into the wild. That day finally came, and the bonded — healthy — coyotes left the comfort of the sanctuary to learn to fend for themselves. Thanks to Sharon’s kindhearted gesture, Princess became the adult everyone had hoped she would.\\n\\nStatement to be answered: Her Dad Brought Home A Strange Puppy. But Look Closely...

       "  ' unworthy of comment.’ Bedtime was historically around 10pm',\n",
       "  ' after which',\n",
       "  ' he added: ‘Most individuals awakened shortly past midnight to an hour or so of consciousness',\n",
       "  ' in which they meditated',\n",
       "  ' they conversed and made love - not necessarily in that order. ‘A 16th century physician said making love was better after the first sleep',\n",
       "  ' when people have more enjoyment and do it better.’ People used the gap between their first and second sleep to wash clothes',\n",
       "  ' have a conversation or even to steal the neighbour’s firewood',\n",
       "  ' historical records show. It was thought that lovemaking between the two sleep phases was responsible for large families',\n",
       "  ' with labourers able to conceive several children because they waited until after their energy-giving first sleep to do it. It was also thought to aid digestion',\n",
       "  ' if people turned from lying on their right to their left when they woke up during the night. References to two phases of sleep go back to Chaucer',\n",
       "  ' with a character in The Squire’s Tale',\n",
       "  ' in the Canterbury Tales',\n",
       "  ' deciding to go back to bed after her ‘firste sleep’. Unless kept awake by a cold house',\n",
       "  ' bed bugs or worry',\n",
       "  ' most people were unconcerned about getting up in the night. It was not seen as insomnia',\n",
       "  ' and ‘sleeplessness’ referred only to failing to fall asleep in the first place. But the practice of having a first and second sleep fell out of favour in the decades following the Industrial Revolution',\n",
       "  ' when people increasingly worked long hours as machine manufacturing dominated British industry. The sleep historian said the shift came at the end of the 19th century',\n",
       "  ' as the end of the first sleep crept later to around 3am',\n",
       "  ' before it was jettisoned altogether. Suddenly sleeping in two phases was seen as inefficient and people were warned that indulging would lead to headaches and constipation. It was even feared that it might',\n",
       "  ' in young men and women',\n",
       "  ' cause ‘lustful thoughts’. Speaking at a Royal society event in London on the subject of sleep',\n",
       "  ' Prof Ekirch said: ‘Sleep represented a necessary evil best confined to a single interval',\n",
       "  ' thus allowing someone to steal the march on the day and on one’s fellow human beings who were still enjoying their second sleep.’ As a result',\n",
       "  ' today',\n",
       "  ' the history professor said',\n",
       "  ' many people who wake at night think they are ‘abnormal’. However research suggests this may be a normal sleeping pattern when people are away from artificial lights and the blue light from electronic devices. Prof Erich said: ‘Rather than the product of an implacable disorder',\n",
       "  ' their sleep',\n",
